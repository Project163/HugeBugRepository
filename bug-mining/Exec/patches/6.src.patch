+        Using variable substitution within CommandLine broke the regression tests
+        under Windows. Found also another bug when calling CommandLine.getExecutable()
+        the result was not substituted at all. As a general rule we do variable
+        substitution and file separator fixing on the command line executable and
+        variable substitution but NO file separator fixing for the command line
+        arguments.

+        Added convinience method to add two parameters to the CommandLine
+        using one method invocation.

         Implemented better regression test for OpenVMS affecting also
         the Executor and CommandLauncher interface.
